# CoughLocalization
Repo about all the techniques used for:
- audio signal processing
- cough annotation based on COCO Dataset
- Deep learning models for cough localization

The repository is mainly composed by:
- utils, for GCP interaction as well as audio processing techinques (e.g. spectrograms)
- tensorflow implementation of spectrogram extractor (from Yamnet), with simble "tf"
- annotators that work within a GCP environment, with tf and librosa audio preprocessing
